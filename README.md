This is Foodie: a web app that takes in the ingredients that you currently have at home and scrapes a database to find recipes that you can make just with those ingredients.



#### Motivation

During this COVID-19 lockdown in many cities, we are all confined to our homes - many have taken up baking and cooking as a hobby. However, starting off as a novice, you may not know what dishes you can cook right now using the ingredients you have. We wish to eliminate any need for you to travel out to a grocery store and risk your health, therefore Foodie shows you what recipes you can make with only the ingredients you provide.



#### Database

The database has been scraped from a recipe website [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com). It features the first 1000 recipes from the website's massive 71000 recipe catalogue. The reason we could not scrape more is due to processing limitations.
